An Apology
==========

I have been spending the last day thinking what I said yesterday evening in the Black Focus chat.

I will start by saying, apologizing for me is a ongoing work. A formal written apology is the start of a accountability process. I am sorry I got stuck on condescending rhetoric that was pessimistically criticizing both members and their views in the group. I want to continue to support the black community on-campus and Olympia. I mirrored my views of politics off Evergreen campus and made demanding comments that expressed my frustrations with that.

My current commitment is to continue to researching and understanding, I want to pull back from policy advocacy work within the group until I can work with the membership and not be the member working against it.
