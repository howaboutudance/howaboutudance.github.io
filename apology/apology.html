<h1 id="an-apology">An Apology</h1>
<p>I have been spending the last day thinking what I said yesterday evening in the Black Focus chat.</p>
<p>I will start by saying, apologizing for me is a ongoing work. A formal written apology is the start of a accountability process. I am sorry I got stuck on condescending rhetoric that was pessimistically criticizing both members and their views in the group. I want to continue to support the black community on-campus and Olympia. I mirrored my views of politics off Evergreen campus and made demanding comments that expressed my frustrations with that.</p>
<p>My *-isms and privlige really showed through, treating everyone as children than as partners. I deeply apologize for this and will work to build relationships that rich and work in coordination with others.</p>
<p>My current commitment is to continue to researching and understanding, I want to pull back from policy advocacy work within the group until I can work with the membership and not be the member working against it. I am still struggling to work on my own improvement and welcome productive critique</p>
