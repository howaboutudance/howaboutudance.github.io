Who are the Faeries:
====================

-   Sub-culture of intersecting communities connected primarily through
    gathering

    -   Gathering – rural usually – campout/retreat – multiple days –
        heart circle – talent shows – ritual

-   founded by for and by gay men

    -   some still are exclusive
    -   transformed in others into a group of
        free-thinkers/counter-cultures queers bounded by common interest
        in self-discovery and gatherings

-   Focuses a lot of self-empowerment and agency

    -   finding one's voice and improving one's life
    -   can be spiritual, purely fun or even a bit serious
    -   “throw off the ugly green frogskin of hetero-imitation to find
        the Faerie Prince beneath" – Hay
    -   Heavily influence by gay liberation and activism, back-to-land
        movement and environmnentlism.
    -   Question hetreonormativity
    -   Will Provide Resources at end for further references
